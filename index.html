			<p id="tekst1">This is Gardenia, your home as a teenage girl.<br> You were just riding in town to get to the park with your pet Kiko the rabbit.<br> When you arrived you heard some strange noises but will you check it out?</p>
			<p id="tip1">You left and never got any idea of the magic that is in your world.</p>
	<button class="button" id="town" type="button" onclick="next();">Check it out</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail1" type="button" onclick="fail1();">Don't check it out</button>
		<p id="tekst2">The noises became louder and it was a fairy fighting a monster. <br> What will you do?</p>
		<p id="tip2">Maybe you should find a weapon.</p>
	<button class="button" id="fight" type="button" onclick="fight();">Fight!</button>
	<button class="button" id="flee" type="button" onclick="flee();">Run away</button>

	<button class="button" id="stok" type="button" onclick="stick();">stick</button>
		<p id="stick"></p>
		<p id="blooms_power">You fought but is was just not enough.<br> Then all out of nowhere you used the power you had all along,<br> but you just never knew about it.<br> You used all the power you had to help her and won.<br> Sadly Stella gave everything and was so tired that she fainted,<br> What do we do now?</p>
		<p id="tip3">You went to the hospital and the world found out that magic was real.</p>
	<button class="button" id="next2" type="button" onclick="next2();">Go home</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail3" type="button" onclick="fail3();">Go to the hospital</button>
		<p id="parents_home">When you got home your parents started to ask some questions and asked what happened. <br>So you told them what happened but they just don't understand it.<br> A few moments later Stella woke up and was all fit again.<br> You went to your room and she asked you something.<br> 'Do you know you have a special ability' and she showed you some tricks she learned.<br> 'I have an idea' Stella said, 'Why don't you come with me to the magical school for fairies?'<br> 'I don't know, Stella. I will think about it.'<br> Stella said: Don't think to long about it because I am until tomorrow in town. <br> She left and asked your parents. <br> suddenly there was a knock on the backdoor.</p> <p id="tip4">You were found and defeated.</p>
	<button class="button" id="next3" type="button" onclick="next3();">Go to the door</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail4" type="button" onclick="fail4();">Go upstairs</button>
		<p id="troll">The door broke and it was the troll you saw in the park, again.<br> He wanted revenge. <br>So you and Stella fought with Knut (his name). <br> You did not know that Stella called the specialists from the Red Fountain and they helped defeat him.</p> <p id="tip5">Stella was hurt badly and could not be saved.</p>
	<button class="button" id="next4" type="button" onclick="next4();">Help Stella</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail5" type="button" onclick="fail5();">Help the specialists</button>
		<p id="specialist"> But he escaped back to his masters. <br> You start to think that this is just the beginning of something big.</p>  <p id="tip6">Never walk away from people who helped you.</p>
	<button class="button" id="next5" type="button" onclick="next5();">talk</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail6" type="button" onclick="fail6();">walk away</button>
		<p id="mangroup">'So who are they?' asked Bloom. <br> 'The names of the specialists are from left to right: Riven, Brandon, Timmy and Sky. <br> But they have to go now.' Stella said. <br> So they left.</p> <p id="tip7">Maybe you should see if your parents are alright.</p> 
	<button class="button" id="next6" type="button" onclick="next6();">Go home</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail7" type="button" onclick="fail7();">Follow them</button>
		<p id="explain">The peace was restored and Bloom's mom and dad were not harmed. <br> But the house was a bit damaged during the fight. <br> Bloom's parents started to clean up the mess.</p> <p id="tip8">You cannot help right now.</p>
	<button class="button" id="next7" type="button" onclick="next7();">Talk about Magix</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail8" type="button" onclick="fail8();">Help cleaning</button>
		<p id="tomagix">Bloom and her parents talked about her going to Magix, and decided that she can go, <br>
		and was surprised to hear that her parents also wanted to come with her. <br> Stella made everything ready and they jumped into the map to magix.</p> <p id="tip9">Just jump in already!</p>
	<button class="button" id="next8" type="button" onclick="next8();">Jump in</button>
	<button class="button" id="fail9" type="button" onclick="fail9();">Don't go</button>
		<p id="insidemagix">Stella said 'Usually the parents can't come with us to Magix, but rules are there to be broken right?'<br> So they went to Magix with Stella and the parents could not believe what they saw. <br> It was a whole new world for them and they were a little bit shocked.</p>
	<button class="button" id="next9" type="button" onclick="next9();">To the forest</button>
	<button class="button" id="next10" type="button" onclick="next10();">To the school</button>
		<p id="ending1">Will Bloom, Stella and her parents find the school or will they be lost in the forest forever? <br> Find it out in the next episode!</p>
		<p id="ending2">Will they enter the school and will Bloom learn new magic? <br> Find it out in the next episode!</p>
	<button class="button" id="next11" type="button" onclick="next11();">next</button>
